                  One last question, what happens to the original account holders?
                </div>

                      The banks must give the money back to the victims.
            <br>
            We know exactly what happens from the moment the original account holder sees the money missing.
            <br>
            They call the bank saying that they wanted to use their account but couldn’t.
            <br>
            The bank asks them a couple of questions, like when was the last time they used their accounts, security questions to make sure they are the original account holders, and then calls the police.
            <br>
            The police will receive the phone call and will say they have more important things to do, like catching terrorists or child rapers.
            <br>
            Nobody is going to investigate nothing for withdrawals under $5000.
            <br>
            Plus, you can only transfer out maximum $1500 from 1 account, so nothing to worry about.
            <br>
            At the end of the day, the banks are the only ones losing money.
            <br>
            You made money, we made money.
            <br>
            The original account holders got their money back from the banks.
